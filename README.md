## 🔍 What is permission-patrol?

permission-patrol is an easy-to-use tool that helps you control app permissions. It uses AI to check and manage requests for permissions when using Claude Code or similar software. This helps keep your computer safe by stopping apps from getting permissions they should not have.

You don’t need any coding skills to use permission-patrol. It works quietly in the background, watching permission requests and letting you know if something seems unsafe.

## ⚙️ How permission-patrol Works

permission-patrol uses a smart program that understands permission requests. When an app asks for access to your computer (like files or microphone), permission-patrol checks if the request is safe.

It does this by:

- Scanning the request in real time with AI models designed to detect risky behavior.
- Alerting you with clear messages if a permission seems unsafe.
- Giving you the option to allow or block each permission.
- Remembering your choices for future requests to avoid asking repeatedly.

You don’t need to decide every time. permission-patrol learns what you trust and blocks suspicious requests automatically.
